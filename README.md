# Stockholm Elixir

This is the official Stockholm Elixir homepage repo.

## Development

    mix deps.get
    mix phoenix.server

Though there isn't much to see right now.

## Test

    mix deps.get
    mix test

## Setting up heroku deploy

This app is deployed at <http://stockholm-elixir.herokuapp.com/>.

    heroku apps:create stockholm-elixir --buildpack https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir.git
    heroku config:set MIX_ENV=prod
    heroku config:set SECRET_KEY_BASE=$(elixir -e "IO.puts :crypto.strong_rand_bytes(64) |> Base.encode64")

    git push heroku master

To enable the chat, `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET` and
`AUTHORIZATION_CALLBACK_URL` must also be set to the values of a
GitHub OAuth application, and SIGNING_KEY must be set to some secret
value.

## Todo

* Add automatic deploy to heroku so that people can contribute without
  having to have heroku access
* Do cool stuff
* Improve the design
* Add content
